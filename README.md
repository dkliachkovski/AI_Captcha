### Main concept about the project was to deliver a *captcha tool*.

<br/>
<br/>

1.	*Neural style transfer*

<br/>

2.	*Captcha implementation based on JS*

> Library of the shown photos is displaying both  original <br/> 
  works of art and fake ones made by neural style transfer.

* Input images - photos of ex. animals

## Here we can easily tell which of the art is the original one and which is not:
